# Pomodoro

Pomodoro technique is famous technique that helps people manage their time more effectively and to get more stuff done.

This technique is based on 25-minutes stretches of focused work followed by 5 minutes break. Once you've repeated it four times you get a long break of 15 minutes to relax or get ready for the next task. This boosts your productivity and increases your ability to say focused. So this basically really effectively utilizes the way that our brain works to take short breaks often and to work for 25 minutes at a time,which helps us with information retention and keeps up the motivation.



How this program works?

       When you figure out what task to do, click on Start. 
       The timer will be set to 25 minutes and you have to begin with the work. 
       After 25 minutes, the timer of 5 minutes will begin wherein you have to take a break and stretch out a little bit(or take a coffee maybe).  
       Once the break is over you can get back to work and focus for 25 minutes again. 
       On completion of the pomodoro, a tick mark will be displayed on the screen. 
       This process is repeated 4 times and finally, you get a long 15-minutes break.


If you want to restart the task/timer or if you wish to begin with another work, you can click on Reset. This will begin the timer from the begining i.e. the            first pomodoro.
